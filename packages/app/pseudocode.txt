Add a search function to access donunt shops in Yelp API
Lookup function: given a city and state, should return donut shops from Yelp API matching inputted values
Hide API key in my .env file in gitignore
Use API key variable to reference actual API key value

Contact API:
    Request URL endopoint (Will need to confirm endpoint I want to use) - Use Postman
    Check for errors - add test for (un)successful connection to API 
    If unsuccessful API connection,
        print errors
    If successful, 
        get JSON response returned,
    Parse Response

    To dynamically search for donut shops, need POST method
    In app.py create a function to call lookup function
    Use search form with city and state inputs to submit a search for donut shops
    If search is unsuccessful,
        return error/apology
    If search is successful,
        return rendered template that display search values
    Otherwise, if none of the above,
        return get/display the empty search form

    Questions: In order to view the data from Yelp, if I'm not using JavaScript do I have to save data to db?
